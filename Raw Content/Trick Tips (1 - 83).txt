Trick Tips

INSERT INTO skatetricks VALUES (1, 'Nollie (Tip 1)', 'To do a nollie you need to know what to do for the trick and where to place your feet. To get in Nollie you have to get in fakie and then get into switch and you\'ll be moving backwards in switch to be in Nollie. The feet position is important. Your right foot goes on the tail for goofy or left foot for regular and your back foot in the middle of the board. This trick is extremly hard for a beginner to learn while moving so learn it while standing still in one place then once you got that done you can try it while moving. With your right or left foot that is on the tail snap it down, and your foot that is in the middle drag it up like you would for a ollie. This trick is just like a fakie ollie so it shou;dn\'t be that hard; and just think its a regular fakie ollie. Just be in Nollie position. When you learn to do switch ollies, nollies should not be hard at all. Remember to snap your foot down as quick as you can to get you pop higher and remember to drag your foot like a ollie or you wont get the board in the air. To Nollie higher you need to just pop the tail as hard as you can and you need to drag your foot(your probably getting tired of reading that). Bend your knees when you are doing the trick. Theres not more to this trick, Just don\'t forget to practice. You\'ll get this trick soon ', 'Flat Land');
INSERT INTO skatetricks VALUES (2, 'Nollie (Tip 2)', 'A Nollie is basically a switch Ollie, except that you\'re riding on the nose. It helps to try to learn to switch Ollie and Nollie at one time to get used to the feeling it takes when riding this position. 1. To begin, place your switch foot comfortably on the nose and your back foot across the middle of the board. The stance varies between people so make sure how you are positioned is comfortable to you. 2. Push down on the nose to get the pop: the harder you push, the higher you go. Just remember to bring up your knees to get a good distance into the air. Your back foot plays an important roll because it helps the board come off the ground by sliding up the board. 3. Once you\'ve reached you maximum height, the board should have leveled out flat. Usually your feet will be over the bolts. 4. Wait for the landing, and like everybody says, absorb the impact and roll away as smoothly as possible. ', 'Flat Land');
INSERT INTO skatetricks VALUES (3, 'Manual', 'A manual can easily be called a "wheelie" for the skateboard, it consists of the rider either rolling or ollieing into a two wheeled riding position on the back wheels. 1. To Ollie into a Manual, simply get into your Ollie stance and once ready to get onto your object ( I suggest starting on low objects first, like curbs) pop a decent Ollie. 2. Once you are over the object and the back wheels have cleared the height, simply plant your back wheels down and lean back as if going for a 5-0 grind. 3. Try to keep your balance and keep the board as level as possible to ride on the back of your board. 4. Go the distance 5. Depending on the obstacle you can level out and ride off, if there is a slight gap or something to clear you may have to pop on the tail a bit. ', 'Flat Land');

If you\'re Regular footed you turn out to your left, if you\'re Goofy footed you turn out to your right. 1. Get into your standard Ollie position, while rolling at a comfortable speed. 2. Bend your knees and turn your shoulders against the direction you will be turning. 3. Pop your Ollie and bring up your knees to get height on your 180 4. This is important! As you pop your Ollie you should begin to turn out, try your best not to lean back. 5. As you come around and you level out, prepare for landing. Remember the best landing is one over bolts 6.

I’d suggest learning this trick before the Kickflip. \r\n<br /><br />1. Start off rolling at a comfortable speed and riding in your Ollie position. This is normally the case with this trick but your feet can be set up a bit differently. <br />2. Pop up and kick your back foot behind you just as you do making sure to bring those knees up. If done correctly this will cause the board to spin inwardly under you. Make sure your shoulders straight and lined with the board. Don’t twist your body during the effort. <br />3.

Come up to your target and pop a Half-Cab, Getting on top shouldn\'t be much of a problem. When you are in the air have your weight on your back foot so you are ready to land on a manual. A very big tip is to try to stop spinning in the air once you are done or to slow down because once you land on a manual and you don\'t do that you will keep spinning and fall.

If you have more trouble then go to the B/S 180 Page and Do everything the same but going fakie. \r\nUsually when I go fakie I can spin faster so the spinning shouldn\'t be a problem.

When you Ollie you shouldn\'t be over top of the ledge and if you land and the board is over the ledge, don’t ollie so high or ollie earlier.

INSERT INTO skatetricks VALUES (23, 'Boardslide ', 'This is the easiest of the slide tricks and will get you used to the feeling of how your board slides on different obstacles. It also serves as a good warm-up trick on an obstacle for more advanced skaters, in order to gauge how that particular obstacle slides. Approach the object at a very mellow angle. Pop an ollie and get your nose and front truck up and over the object, landing on the deck between the trucks. Center your weight over the board and slide until the end of the obstacle. When nearing departure from the object, start to turn yourself and your board 90 degrees, but don\'t be too anxious or your wheels will hit the object before you come off. A slight bounce off of the end of the object allows you to fly off the end instead of dropping straight down to the ground. Depending on the obstacle, this trick sometimes requires you to lift your front truck over the obstacle while coming off. To do this, put pressure on your tail as you turn off the object, as if you\'re doing a kickturn in the air. ', 'Slide');
INSERT INTO skatetricks VALUES (24, 'Frontside Board Slide (Tip 2)', 'This trick can be intimidating, especially since it\'s the first blindside trick that a skater usually learns. Approach the obstacle frontside at a mellow angle. Pop an ollie and get your nose and front truck up and over the object, landing on the deck between the trucks. If you plan on landing in your regular stance, keep your shoulders facing the same direction the whole time and let your hips do the turning. If you plan on landing fakie, your shoulders should be facing backside with the board while sliding.

Pop an ollie and get your back truck on the ledge (again, like you were going to do a 50-50). Instead of putting your front truck down, you want to try to stay in the manual position. This requires more forward momentum and backward lean than a manual, depending of course on the butter factor of the obstacle in question. Just hold on to that grind as long as you can or until the end of the object and come off as if you were coming out of a manual on a curb. A good way to lock into 5-0 grinds is to angle the board out like a smith grind, only pointing up instead of down. This will let you apply more pressure towards the obstacle to keep that back truck in position, and don\'t be afraid to let your tail drag along the surface (Watch Rick McCrank\'s 5-0s for a good lesson on this method). \r\n\r\nWhen performed this way, frontside 180s and shuvits out flow almost naturally. \r\n', 'Grind');

If you come parallel with the target you only have to do a 90 instead of a 180. If you still think you should come at a bigger angle the try a lower target. Once you are comfortable with coming parallel with your target Ollie forward like a F/S 50-50 but turn a F/S 180 while jumping over your target.

Keeping your balance while doing this trick is kind of hard because you leaning back and your feet are in front of you and its just harder than a 50-50. You should always approach your target with speed. If your doing this on a low ledge or whatever don\'t Ollie to high because then when you land you just freeze and bail. I am not sure how to get off to well but your best hope is to A: if the target ends at a drop off- when your getting close to coming of 50-50 and do a manual kind of thing and land (like manualing of a curb.

Catch the board after it has flipped half way and grind across your object. Your feet should be on the nose and the tail while you grind.
