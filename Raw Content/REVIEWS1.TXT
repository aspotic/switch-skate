Coliseum - PJ Ladds Wonderful Horrible Life

This is a local shop video that has gone wild. And for a good reason too. Many people haven't heard of most of the skaters in this video: Jereme Rogers, Alexis Sablone, Colin Fiske, Southie, Ryan Gallant, Dave Vey, Dave Armsden, Baby Schizo, and P.J. Ladd. Everybody has a good part in this video, especially the final part of PJ Ladd. He is he reason why this video became so popular. Watch his part to see many technical tricks done so smoothly and effortlessly (at least it seems like it!). This is a video that you must see because watching this video will blow your mind and make you want o skate!
