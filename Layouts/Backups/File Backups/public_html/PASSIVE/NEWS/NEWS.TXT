<b><u>Layout</u></b> - <b>By:</b> Tox - <b>On:</b> <i>5/1/05</i><br>
		Layout is nearly finished but for some stupid reason I am having trouble connecting to the site VIA FTP and it is kind of annoying me. So I will not have it online for some time I do not think, or atleast, not until I get the FTP working.<br><br><br>

		<b><u>Plans</u></b> - <b>By:</b> Tox - <b>On:</b> <i>April 22, 2005</i><br>
		Okay, I have decided that I will not have a tutorial site because, as you all know, I am a lazy son of a bitch. So I am going to bring back Toxic. For one reason mainly, I missed it. I love Toxic and each time I try to get rid of it I always bring it back. Yeah, odd? I know, but I will make due. So, the plans are as follows.<br>
I will first make the site<br>
You will not see it<br>
I will get a new host<br>
I\'ll upload the site<br>
And you will visit it every day because you will love it so much. :)<br><br><br>
